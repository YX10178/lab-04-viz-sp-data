### Load packages and data
```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("rstudio-education/dsbox")
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox) 
```

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
Dennys <- dsbox::dennys
Laquinta <- dsbox::laquinta
states <- read_csv("data/states.csv")
```

### Exercise 1
```{r dimensions of the Dennys dataset}
cat ("There are", nrow (Dennys), "rows and", ncol(Dennys), "variables in the Dennys dataset.", "\n") 

###There are six variables: address, city, state, zip code, longitude, and latitude. Each row represents one Denny's store. 
```

### Exercise 2
```{r dimensions of the La Quinta dataset}
cat ("There are", nrow (Laquinta), "rows and", ncol(Laquinta), "variables in the Laquinta dataset.", "\n") 

###There are six variables: address, city, state, zip code, longitude, and latitude. Each row represents one La Quinta store. 
```
### Exercise 3
```{r any La Quinta and Dennys locations outside of the US?}
## from the website, La Quinta has some stores across the world, for instance, in South America: Chile, Colombia, Ecuador. In Asia: China. In Europe: Turkey. 
## All Danny's stores are in the US.
```

### Exercise 4
```{r any Dennys and La Quinta locations outside of the US?}
##Denny's 
non_us_states_dennys<-setdiff(states$abbreviation, Dennys$state)
print(non_us_states_dennys)
##all Denny's stores are in the US

##La Quinta 
non_us_states_LaQ<-setdiff(Laquinta$state, states$abbreviation)
print(non_us_states_LaQ)
## There are stores in "AG"  "QR"  "CH"  "NL"  "ANT" "ON"  "VE"  "PU"  "SL"  "FM"  "BC" outside of the US. 
```


### Exercise 5
```{r Dennys locations outside the US}
##Denny's locations outside the US
Dennys %>%
  filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))
##Note that the %in% operator matches the states listed in the state variable to those listed in states$abbreviation. The ! operator means not.
